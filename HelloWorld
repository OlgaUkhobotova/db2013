Try to fix BUG with github [My commits appears like 'Frodox' commits]
Change user.email to e-mail of another user.
Change user.email back, to Vitaly Rybnikov's. First BUG with GitHub - fixed

Bug with date - my commites dated with 20.02.13, but it's 21.02.13
Set date : 24.02.13 11:13

On GitHub it's now look like commit from 23.02.13. Why?!
Date of commit relate to date of locale PC,
and Commiter is relate to user.email settings on locale Machine.
Hmmm...Something wrong!
Set date to 22.02.13 11:31

Test PUSH from Notebook with new ssh-keys
